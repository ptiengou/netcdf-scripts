# netcdf-scripts

Code developped during my PhD to analyse netcdf files (model outputs, observations).

Notebooks were used with Python 3.12.

Create a conda environment created with all the dependencies from environment.yml :
`conda create --name lam1env -f environment.yml`

Launch jupyter kernel from env :
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name lam1env --display-name "Python (lam1env)"`
